## About this Project

This project works in tandem with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) to create an analytics report that elaborates on the impacts of Covid-19 on crime rates for Tennessee during the year 2020 in comparison to projections from the years 2018-19, with special emphasis on describing instances of **When** and **Where** Domestic Violence (DV) occur during 2020.
